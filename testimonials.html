    <h2>Inmate Testimonials</h2>
    <p>Real accounts from those who’ve worked through prison labor.</p>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <blockquote>
        "Under the 13th amendment slavery was not abolished, it was merely reformed." <br>
        “Prisoners who do not agree to such abject slavery are put in solitary confinement. I know from personal experience.”
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>- Kevin Rashid Johnson, VA Facility</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <blockquote>
        “The days would run together. The heat, the drudgery, the daily unpaid toiling in dirt and fields under the hot Texas sun.”
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>- Timothy D.V. Bazrowx, TX Facility Field Worker</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <blockquote>
        "My muscles were in agony, and getting too weak for the work. My shoulders were on fire. My back ached. “Keep pushing!” the city contractor yelled, from high up above. I was down in a wastewater-treatment pit in a central Georgia city, and kept furiously shoving the black liquid toward the pump, with a squeegee."
    </blockquote>
      <p><strong>- Adrian Drepaul, GA Facility Janitor</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <blockquote>
        "They can say, 'Oh it's not like that, and oh, we don't force labor, and oh, it's OK.' But you have so many women on the inside now that are afraid to speak out."
    </blockquote>
      <p><strong>- Lakiera Walker, AL Facility Roadworker and SA Victim</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <blockquote>
        “I was terrified for my life. I didn’t want to die this close to going home,” 
    </blockquote>
